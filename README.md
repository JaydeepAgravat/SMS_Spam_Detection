# SMS Spam Detection

> [WEB APP](https://sms-spam--detection.streamlit.app/)

**Main objective**

> The goal is to create a system that can accurately classify incoming text messages as either spam or not spam.
> Users should be able to input text messages into the web app, and the system should identify whether message is likely to be spam or not.
> The application should provide a user-friendly interface for inputting messages and displaying the classification results clearly.

   - To achieve this objective, it was further broken down into the following 6 technical sub-objectives:
     1. Data Gathering
     2. Clean the Data
     3. SMS Text Analysis
     4. Feature Engineering
     5. Rule Based SMS Spam Detection
     6. A Machine Learning Approach to SMS Spam Detection
